# PROBLEM STATEMENT
- In the realm of gaming, traditional game development often faces challenges related to ownership, scarcity, and interoperability of in-game assets. Players 
invest time and money into acquiring digital items, yet lack true ownership and control over these assets. Centralized game platforms control the distribution 
and monetization of in-game items, limiting players' autonomy and hindering the potential for a vibrant secondary market.
- Moreover, players encounter difficulties in seamlessly transferring their assets between different games, as each game typically operates within its closed 
ecosystem, lacking interoperability with other platforms.
- In response to these challenges, there arises a need for a decentralized NFT (Non-Fungible Token) card game that empowers players with true ownership, 
scarcity, and interoperability of in-game assets while fostering a vibrant player-driven economy.

# KEY ISSUES
- Ownership and Scarcity: Traditional game platforms often lack mechanisms to provide players with true ownership and scarcity of in-game assets, diminishing their value and appeal.

- Interoperability: Limited interoperability between different game platforms restricts players from transferring their assets seamlessly, inhibiting the growth of a vibrant secondary market.

- Centralized Control: Centralized game platforms exercise control over the distribution, monetization, and governance of in-game assets, limiting players' autonomy and participation in decision-making processes.
