# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
     - In the realm of gaming, traditional game development often faces challenges related to ownership, scarcity, and interoperability of in-game assets. Players 
     invest time and money into acquiring digital items, yet lack true ownership and control over these assets. Centralized game platforms control the distribution 
     and monetization of in-game items, limiting players' autonomy and hindering the potential for a vibrant secondary market.
     
     - Moreover, players encounter difficulties in seamlessly transferring their assets between different games, as each game typically operates within its closed 
     ecosystem, lacking interoperability with other platforms.
	
     - In response to these challenges, there arises a need for a decentralized NFT (Non-Fungible Token) card game that empowers players with true ownership, 
       scarcity, and interoperability of in-game assets while fostering a vibrant player-driven economy.
